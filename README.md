## Module Title
An Introduction to Security and Risk Management

## Learning Outcomes
Through my studies in Security and Risk Management, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles that underpin modern approaches to identifying and managing risk in information systems and organisational contexts.

Firstly, I have explored and compared various definitions of risk, recognising that the concept is inherently context-dependent. Standards such as ISO 31000 (2018) define risk as the “effect of uncertainty on objectives,” while NIST SP 800-30 (Stoneburner et al., 2002) interprets it as the combination of threat likelihood and impact on assets. Furthermore, Blakley et al. (2001) argue that information security itself is a form of risk management, emphasising that security decisions should be based on balancing protection costs against potential losses. These perspectives have enhanced my appreciation that risk is not solely negative but involves managing uncertainty to achieve strategic objectives.

Secondly, I have learned to assess, qualify, and mitigate risks using a structured, systematic approach. Risk assessment involves identifying assets, threats, and vulnerabilities; evaluating the likelihood of occurrence; and estimating the potential impact. This process enables organisations to prioritise risks according to their severity. I have also learned that risks can be mitigated through strategies such as avoidance, reduction, transfer, or acceptance (ISO, 2018). Effective mitigation requires aligning security controls with organisational priorities, demonstrating that risk management is both a technical and managerial discipline.

Thirdly, I can now describe and apply approaches to quantify and qualify risks. Quantitative methods, such as the Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE) model, assign numerical values to risks to support cost-benefit analyses, whereas qualitative approaches use expert judgment and categorical scales (e.g., high, medium, low) to describe risks where data may be insufficient. A hybrid approach that combines both provides a balanced and context-aware understanding of risk exposure.

Finally, I have developed the ability to identify and apply common security and risk management standards. I can distinguish between frameworks such as ISO 31000, which provides general risk management guidance, ISO/IEC 27001, which specifies information security management system (ISMS) requirements, and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), which offers detailed procedural steps for assessing and mitigating IT-related risks. The ability to select the most appropriate framework depends on organisational objectives, regulatory environment, and industry context — for example, applying PCI DSS in financial sectors or NIST SP 800-37 in public institutions.

Overall, this learning has enhanced my ability to analyse complex organisational environments, evaluate risks systematically, and apply internationally recognised standards to protect assets and ensure resilience. These competencies are essential for professional practice in cybersecurity, information governance, and enterprise risk management.
